    <p>
    During my internship at a petroleum refinery, I got the opportunity to understand real industrial operations beyond textbooks.
    I observed distillation columns, heat exchangers, pumps, and control systems in action.
    </p>

    <p>
    One of the most exciting parts was visiting the control room where engineers monitor pressure, temperature, and flow rates in real-time.
    It helped me connect theoretical knowledge of process control with practical applications.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also learned about safety protocols, emergency shutdown systems (ESD), and plant maintenance procedures.
    This experience significantly improved my understanding of process engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
    Internships are extremely important for chemical engineering students as they provide real industry exposure and improve problem-solving skills.
